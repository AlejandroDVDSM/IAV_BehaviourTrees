# IAV_BehaviourTrees

This project was made to learn AI and behaviour trees. It uses Panda BT to make a blue NPC help the player. This NPC patrol around the player and will attack any enemy that is close to him. If the player health is reduced to a certain point, it will move between the enemy and the player to block all hostile projectiles.
